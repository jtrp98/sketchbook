# Web Interface Guidelines (local copy)

Review files for compliance with the rules in [`references/rules.md`](references/rules.md). Read-only: report findings, never edit the target.

## How It Works

1. Read `references/rules.md` (pinned local copy, see `SOURCE.txt`). Do **not** fetch rules from the network at review time: the upstream file can change without review.
2. Read the specified files (or ask which files/pattern to review). For a Design canvas artifact, read the published HTML with the Artifact tool (`action: "read"`), not a local copy.
3. Check against the rules and output findings in the terse `file:line` format given at the end of `references/rules.md`.

## Scope in sketchbook

The rules target web apps (React/Next.js). Apply them to canvas HTML and web pages only:

- Skip as "not applicable": Hydration Safety, Performance items about frameworks/lists, `Intl.*`/locale items when the artifact is static, and English-only copy rules (Title Case, Chicago style, active voice, `&` for "and", numerals) for Thai copy.
- For Thai copy use the team's rules instead: `projects/<name>/brand.md` (voice) and `knowledge/ui-design-58-rules.md` (UI24 Thai typography).
- Results are one input to `highlighter` (Role 4). Contrast, touch target size and brand tokens still come from `knowledge/` and `projects/<name>/brand.md`; this skill does not check them.
- If a rule conflicts with the project's brand or `knowledge/`, report it as a finding and name the conflict. Do not pick silently.

## Updating the rules

To refresh `references/rules.md` from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/main/command.md`, diff it first, read the changes, then update `SOURCE.txt` (date + sha256). Never auto-apply.
